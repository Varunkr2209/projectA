# Job Title Categorization API

A robust and extensible Flask-based REST API that categorizes job titles by extracting:
- **Function**: Broad job domains like Marketing, Sales, Engineering
- **Sub-function**: Specialized areas such as Growth, Backend Development
- **Seniority**: Job level like Entry, Senior, Director, etc.

This API uses alias normalization, regular expressions, and fuzzy matching (via RapidFuzz) for intelligent, high-confidence categorization. It is designed with performance, observability, and extensibility in mind.

## üìå Use Cases

- Structuring HR databases with standardized job taxonomy
- Enhancing analytics on job titles for recruitment platforms
- Cleaning and enriching user-submitted job title data

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

-  Accepts both single and batch job title inputs via JSON
-  Intelligent fuzzy and regex-based matching
-  Confidence scoring and warning reporting
-  Fast with in-memory caching and thread pool processing
-  Health and readiness endpoints for observability
-  Deploy-ready with Docker and Gunicorn
-  Includes CORS, rate-limiting, and secure response headers

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "matched": true,
      "warnings": [],
      "original_title": "Junior Backend Dev",

### Health & Maintenance
- `GET /health` ‚Äì Basic service uptime check
- `GET /ready` ‚Äì Readiness probe for config & service health
- `POST /reload-config` ‚Äì Reloads YAML config mappings dynamically

---

##  Configuration

Environment variables can control:
- `CONFIG_PATH`: Path to YAML file for function, seniority, and alias mappings
- `MIN_CONFIDENCE`: Minimum match confidence (default: 0.7)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- `DEBUG`: Enables Flask debug mode

Default mappings are used if the config file is missing.

---

## YAML Mapping Format

Example `mappings.yaml`:

```yaml
functions:
  Marketing:
    digital: "Digital Marketing"
    content: "Content Marketing"
  Sales:
    account: "Account Management"

seniority:
  junior: "Entry"
  lead: "Manager"

aliases:
  mgr: "manager"
  eng: "engineer"
```
